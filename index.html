            <!-- Five Components of Fitness -->
            <h4 class="title"><span class="has-text-primary">Five Components of Fitness</span>
            <ul class="subtitle mt-3">
                <li><strong>1. BODY COMPOSITION:</strong><br>This isn't just about weight; it's about what makes up that weight. Body composition is the proportion of fat and non-fat in your body. It provides insights into your fitness level and potential health risks. A good body composition means having a good balance of body fat and muscle. We will talk more about this later.</li>
                <li><strong>2. CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS:</strong><br>This is the powerhouse combo of your heart and lungs. It gauges how efficiently they work together to fuel your muscles with oxygen during prolonged physical activities. Boosting cardiorespiratory fitness means enhancing your body's ability to take in oxygen and deliver it to your cells, making activities like running, swimming, or cycling easier and more enjoyable.</li>
                <li><strong>3. FLEXIBILITY:</strong><br>It's not just about touching your toes! Flexibility is the range of motion in a joint or group of joints. Regular stretching can improve flexibility, which in turn improves your performance in physical activities, decreases your risk of injuries, and ensures your joints remain healthy.</li>
                <li><strong>4. MUSCULAR ENDURANCE:</strong><br>This is all about stamina. It determines how long your muscles can sustain an activity before they get tired. For instance, how many squats or push-ups can you do in a row? Activities like rowing, climbing, or circuit training can boost muscular endurance, ensuring you can keep going for longer without feeling fatigued.</li>
                <li><strong>5. MUSCULAR STRENGTH:</strong><br>This is the raw power your muscles can generate. It's about how much force they can exert in a single effort. Building muscular strength involves resistance training, like weightlifting or resistance band exercises. Stronger muscles not only help in daily tasks but also protect your joints from injuries.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            
            <!-- FITT Formula -->
            <h4 class="title"><span class="has-text-primary">FITT Formula</span>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3"><strong>F - FREQUENCY:</strong><br>Depending on what you’re trying to do, frequency can change. If you are doing cardo and trying to burn fat, your body doesn’t need as much recovery, so you can do it more often, something like 5 times a week works. Or if you’re trying to build muscle/ lift weights, 2-3 can work. Start slow to avoid injury and gradually increase the frequency as your body adapts.</p>
            <p class="subtitle"><strong>I - INTENSITY:</strong><br>Pay attention to your heart rate, make sure it stays under control. For strength training, start with weights that you can lift for 12-15 reps without straining, then gradually increase the weight as you become stronger. Focus on form and don’t increase the weight until your form is near perfect, ego lifting hurts your gains and can cause injury.</p>
            <p class="subtitle"><strong>T - TIME:</strong><br>Aim for a minimum of 20 minutes per session. For cardiovascular workouts, 20-30 minutes is a good starting point, but you can increase this as your stamina improves. For strength training, the duration might vary based on the number of sets and exercises you're doing, but ensuring you're working out each muscle group adequately is key. Try not to overload yourself, maintaining motivation is just as important as maintaining gains.</p>
            <p class="subtitle"><strong>T - TYPE:</strong><br>Again, this will vary depending on your goals. To burn fat, engage in aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercises, such as walking, jogging, cycling, and swimming, are great for improving cardiovascular health, burning calories, and boosting mood. Now, for strength training, in addition to lifting, don’t forget to perform flexibility exercises, and balance workouts. This ensures all muscle groups are worked, reduces the risk of injury, and improves overall functional fitness.</p>

              Most food labels will look like figure A. However, if the container has more than one serving but typically might
              be consumed in one sitting, such as a pint of ice cream, the label will have two additional columns like in label B.

              <p class="subtitle"><strong>1. Serving size and servings per container</strong><br>Don't let this fool you! Everything on the label is based on serving size, there can be many servings in the entire container. This product has 8 servings, each being a 2/3 cup.</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>2. Calories</strong><br>What your looking for here may vary from person to person, but most people should be eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day (we will talk more about this later), and the label shows calories per serving.</p>
              <p class="subtitle"><strong>3. Basic nutrition</strong><br>The less saturated fat the better, keep away from high sugar or sodium content, this will vary from person to person as well.</p>

              <h5 class="subtitle mt-2"><strong><u>Everything you need to know</u></strong></h5>

            <h4 class="title">Understanding Eating Disorders</h4>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                Understanding eating disorders is crucial for both awareness and prevention. These conditions often stem from complex interactions between biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors. They can have severe health consequences and can be fatal if not treated appropriately.<br><br>
              </p>
    
            <h4 class="title">What are eating disorders?</h4>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                Eating disorders are serious and often fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person's eating behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder. These disorders can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, gender, or background.<br><br>
            </p>
    
            <h4 class="title">Anorexia Nervosa vs. Bulimia Nervosa</h4>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                <strong>Anorexia Nervosa:</strong> Characterized by weight loss, difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for height, age, and stature, and, in many individuals, distorted body image. People with anorexia generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food they eat.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                <strong>Bulimia Nervosa:</strong> Involves episodes of eating large amounts of food followed by behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting. A feeling of being out of control during the binge-eating episodes is a hallmark of bulimia.<br><br>
            </p>
    
            <h4 class="title">Muscle Dysmorphia</h4>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                Often referred to as "bigorexia", muscle dysmorphia is a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's characterized by an obsession with not being muscular enough. Those affected might spend long hours at the gym, obsessively focus on their diet, and frequently check their body in the mirror, but still perceive themselves as being too small.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle mt-3">
                It's essential to recognize the signs of these disorders and seek help if you or someone you know is struggling. Early intervention and treatment is crucial.
